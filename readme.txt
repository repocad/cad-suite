  SIIGNA MODULES
  This is the default Siigna modules. Modules contain a default set of drawing tools that allow users 
  to create and manipulate artwork in the Siigna application. The application itself is coded in MAINLINE.
  The mainline facilitates a system for sending commands via messages, allowing entire drawings of parts 
  of drawings to be send dynamically and viewed on other instances of Siigna in real time. 
  it is possible replace or add to the default modules to facilitate different drawing fundtionality.

  ABOUT SIIGNA
  Siigna is an online open-source 2d CAD application that runs online on the Java platform.
  it is intended to suit the needs of different groups. Therefore the backbone of Siigna, the mainline, 
  is relatively small and a majority of functionality is branched out into modules. The idea is that Siigna 
  can be loaded with different sets of modules, creating different modes for generating different types of artwork.
